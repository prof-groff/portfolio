## On the Topic of Student Success, or How Failure Cultivates

### The following was my response to a question possed by the Faculty Merit Foundation of West Virginia and included with my nomination materials for West Virginia's 2019 Professor of the Year. The question was, "Describe the successful college student. What qualities and characteristics should he or she bring from previous educational pursuits and life experiences?"

Dear Faculty Merit Foundation of WV Board of Directors,

A faculty member once told me that his teaching goal was to make little graduate-school-bound copies of himself. His definition of student success was based on his values projected onto his students. But, success is defined by values that are not universal and are shaped by educational histories and life experiences as varied as any other characteristic our students have. It follows that there is not a unique set of qualities or characteristics that describe a successful college student. Success is individualized. This is an insight that makes me a better mentor to my students. It reminds me of the need to learn as much as I can about my students’ values, goals, and abilities if I want to maximize my effectiveness as an advisor and a teacher. This is challenging, but the more experience I gain as a teacher, and as a father, the better I get at this and the more I love it.

Regardless of how success is individually defined and however diverse the qualities and characteristics of successful college students, I do believe that there are certain “qualities of mind” or mindsets that are helpful and worth working to instill in students. The most important of these is what is sometimes called the growth mindset. This begins with understanding that our brains are malleable and cognitive ability develops through dedicated effort. Framing development in this way leads students to the realization that failure is a normal and common aspect of their development instead of an indication of the limits of their abilities. Failure is an opportunity to grow. In fact, if the aim is improvement, failure gives students more useful information than success.

The growth mindset also involves teaching students to gauge their accomplishments in terms of change over time instead of simply checking off goals. This isn’t to say that goals are bad, but setting goals has no utility unless you also set about implementing habits or systems that allow you to work toward these goals and assess how you are doing. If a student hasn’t reached a goal, it might be because there’s a problem with the student’s methods, not the goal itself. Focusing on growth allows students to more effectively determine what is working and not working. If a goal changes, no problem, the student’s system still yielded a tremendous amount of growth to be proud of. In addition, the growth mindset emphasizes personal change over comparisons to others. The achievements of others are inspirational and should be celebrated, but it is more useful for students to compare themselves to their past selves instead of comparing themselves to others. 

Applied over time, students who adopt a growth mindset will learn that future growth and success are largely determined by their efforts and attitude and not by their current knowledge and abilities. This leads to a particularly powerful kind of confidence tempered by humility. They do not expect solutions to be easy or quick, but students with a growth mindset are still comfortable in situations where the path to success is uncertain because they have developed mental tools to assertively confront novel problems in unfamiliar territory without giving up. They’ve become mentally resilient. 

I’d like to thank the Faculty Merit Foundation Of West Virginia for the opportunity to share my work. Being nominated for Professor of the Year is one of the highest honors of my career. I look forward to meeting with members of the board should I be selected as a finalist.
	
Sincerely,
